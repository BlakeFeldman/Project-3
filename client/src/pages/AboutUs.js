            <h3>Our Inspiration</h3>

          <p>
          Everybody is born different, because of those differences, unfortunately, some children
          are isolated, shunned, bullied and made fun of through no fault of their own â€” it's not ok.
          Special Needs United is a web application aimed to help families
          with special needs children. By providing resources specific to special needs, 
          parents, grandparents, friends, the general public, and even the children
          dealing with their differences can get a better understanding of their
          condition and learn the skills needed to live a normal everyday life. 
          Special Needs United, providing resources that turn helpless to hopeful.
          Find support and unity when dealing with children with special needs. <br></br>
          We're there when you need us. 
          </p>
