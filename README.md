"Think Globally.  Act Locally.  Get Involved!"

Intent:  The intent of "Special Needs United" is to bring together a vital community of interest to improve the lives of Special Needs Children, their parents, friends, family, and allies.  Sign up for the website by creating a profile.  List your "interests" to share with the community what type of engagement you are looking for on this platform.  For example, are you here to learn or are you an expert who has knowledge to share?  For "services" use one word to state what service you are prepared to offer or request.  For example, something as simple as a carpool or babysitting service can provide tremendous relief to parents who are in need of a break.  How can we help make a difference for you?
